# Custom Excel File Generator

## The what? and why?
A customizable Excel file generator for use in testing and education.

## Features
* Has a User-friendly GUI
* Supports customizable file names, orientation, category labels, data types, max file length, and more.
* Also provides options for randomization and error entries.

## Architecture and Design Choices
* I've chosen a modular and layered architecture for its clear and readable file structure. This means that the project will be divided into multiple files, each with its purpose, and the main program will execute from the file main.py.
* I've also opted for a config.json file to store user settings.
* This program will use openpyxl to create and modify Excel files and Faker for specific data entry purposes.

## Challenges and Lessons Learnt
